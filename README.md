#### :date: Timeframe for the project
The challenge was to complete the analysis withing 1 week. (17.03.20-24.03.20)

#### :clapper: Presentation

The work is done in a Jupyter Notebook, whereas the final presentation of the results is created with Google Datastudio. A PDF of the report can also be found in the repository.

#### :dart: Findings

While we could make a few general observations of the measurements of UFC Fighters and the outcome of fights, we found that the most interesting aspect was to see how much of an advantage a fighter who was rated as the favorite had in comparison to the other corner. In other words, how likely is it to win in the red (favorite) corner?<br>
Our answer was a clear yes, as is easily seen in the below chart, and can be further elaborated upon in the future.
